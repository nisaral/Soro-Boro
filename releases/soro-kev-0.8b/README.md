## Model summary

Soro-Kev-0.8B is a specialized decision model for AI agent tool routing, schema normalization, and execution boundary control. It reads the state (user prompt, conversational history, and available tool schemas) and returns a closed-set probability distribution over the options supplied with a question. Each question is scored in a prefill-only forward pass; the model does not generate text.

It is built directly on top of Jared Palmer's Kev pointer architecture, addressing an explicit limitation documented in the original Kev-0.8B model card (*"Tool-call routing: its When2Call accuracy is below chance (0.133). Do not use it for tool-call routing"*). Soro-Kev-0.8B is trained specifically on multi-protocol tool catalogs (Model Context Protocol, REST/OpenAPI, Agent Skills, and Python signatures), raising tool routing accuracy to 85.67% (1,028/1,200) on held-out MCP & agent benchmarks, and 83.00% (83/100) on BFCL v3 tool selection.

It consists of a LoRA adapter ($r=16, \alpha=32$) and a pointer head on `Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base`. It runs in ~124.2 ms on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU (1,563 MB peak VRAM, PyTorch 2.6.0). It is intended for edge deployment, local MCP desktop sidecars, and high-frequency routing pipelines where generative LLM token generation latency is prohibitive.

## Model details

| Field | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Developer** | Keyush Nisar ([github.com/nisaral/Soro-Boro](https://github.com/nisaral/Soro-Boro)) |
| **Model type** | Decision model: causal language-model backbone run prefill-only, with a pointer head over candidate options |
| **Backbone** | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base`: 24 layers (18 Gated DeltaNet linear attention, 6 full attention); frozen |
| **Adapter** | LoRA, rank 16, $\alpha$ 32, on `q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj` only. The adapter has 24 modules on the six full-attention layers (`[3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23]`), about 1.08M parameters. There are no MLP or DeltaNet adapters. |
| **Head** | Two 256-d projections from each selected hidden state; each option's closing token is scored against the question's final token (`h_query · h_option / (sqrt(256) · T)`) |
| **Precision** | Trained in bf16/fp16; served in bf16 (merged at load) or fp32; evaluated in fp32 |
| **Context length** | Backbone supports up to 262,144 positions. The public T4-oriented training recipe used a 1,536-token cap, so the adapter was not trained on the full context. |
| **Validated context** | 8,192 tokens in evaluation; not the training cap |
| **Calibration** | Learned temperature `0.075487` and split-conformal quantile `q_hat = 0.9518` at `1 - alpha = 0.90`. The calibration is fitted in training/evaluation; the current production gate does not apply `q_hat`. |
| **Languages** | English (prose, tool descriptions, OpenAPI schemas, JSON-RPC, Python docstrings) |
| **License** | Apache-2.0 |
| **Version** | Soro-Kev 1.0 (release `v0.2.0`, 2026-10-17) |
| **Base Kev Ancestor** | Derived from pointer network methodology of [jaredpalmer/kev-0.8b](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-0.8b) |

## Input and Question Types

Soro-Kev-0.8B evaluates a state and any number of named questions across three typed categories:

| Type | Options | Output | Intended Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **choice (`tool_route`)** | Up to 8 tool schemas + `__abstain__` per forward; larger catalogs use 6-tool chunks and a final top-two pass | Probability per listed tool and `__abstain__`; evaluation also reports calibration sets | Selects the single correct tool to execute, or abstains |
| **choice (`arg_mapping`)** | Schema property keys + `__drop__` | Probability distribution over candidate property names | Maps unrecognized LLM argument keys to target schema parameters |
| **noul (`missing_required`)** | `yes` / `no` with descriptions | Probability that required arguments are missing | Determines whether harness must ask user before calling tool |
| **noul (`is_mutation`)** | `yes` / `no` with descriptions | Probability that action mutates external state | Classifies side-effect tier when MCP tool annotations are absent |

Each question is scored by its own forward pass in the current inference code. Questions do not share a cached state prefix, and the model does not promise a fixed number of questions per forward.

---

## Intended Uses

- **AI Agent Tool Routing**: Selecting tools from catalogs of 10 to 100+ schemas through a shortlist/chunking path without token-by-token JSON generation. The measured 0.8B prefill latency is about 124 ms, not a sub-100 ms guarantee.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Sidecars**: Routing queries to local tools exposed by MCP servers over stdio or SSE.
- **Calibration-Aware Action Boundary**: Training/evaluation can fit LAC prediction sets. The current harness uses a documented top-mass gate; consumers should not assume a finite-sample coverage guarantee from `route()` until `q_hat` loading is wired in.
- **On-Device & Edge Routing**: Running alongside small edge LLMs on consumer laptops, Apple Silicon, or 4 GB GPUs.
- **Duplicate Mutation Protection**: When integrated with the Soro-Boro execution boundary, enforcing the 0-duplicate execution invariant under network dropouts.

## Out-of-Scope Uses

- **Text generation, conversation, or creative writing**: The model runs in prefill-only mode and has no generative token decode loop.
- **Arbitrary general classification without tools**: Out of domain on tasks unlike its training families (e.g. sentiment classification or narrative analysis), where general models like Kev-0.8B or Kev-4B should be used.
- **Fully autonomous execution of high-risk actions**: Financial transfers, database drops, or administrative actions should always require operator confirmation (`ASK` / human-in-the-loop).
- **Languages other than English**: Non-English tool descriptions and prompts are not validated.

## How to Use

### 1. High-Level Python SDK (Soro Harness)

```python
from soro.harness.pipeline import SoroHarness

# Load checkpoint from Hugging Face
harness = SoroHarness.from_pretrained("nisaralll/soro-kev-0.8b")

@harness.tool(description="Check account balance for customer", side_effect="read_only")
def get_balance(customer_id: str) -> dict:
    return {"customer_id": customer_id, "balance_usd": 1420.50}

@harness.tool(description="Issue partial or full refund for settled order", side_effect="mutation")
def refund_order(order_id: str, amount: float) -> dict:
    return {"order_id": order_id, "refunded": amount}

# Fast Calibrated Routing
decision = harness.route("Refund customer $45.00 for order ORD-9921")
print(decision.action)          # "EXECUTE"
print(decision.selected_tool)   # "refund_order"
print(decision.candidates)      # ["refund_order"] (Prediction set |S| = 1)
```

### 2. Low-Level In-Process Scorer

```python
from soro.routing.kev_local import LocalKevScorer

scorer = LocalKevScorer(run="nisaralll/soro-kev-0.8b", backend="neural")
scorer.load()

state = "User Request: Check available disk storage in /var/log"
questions = {
    "tool_route": {
        "type": "choice",
        "instructions": "Which tool should execute for this request?",
        "criteria": {
            "get_disk_usage": "Return total, used, and available disk storage for path.",
            "list_processes": "List active system processes and PIDs.",
            "__abstain__": "None of the listed tools fit."
        }
    }
}

result = scorer.evaluate_turn(state, questions)
print(result["answers"]["tool_route"])  # "get_disk_usage"
print(result["probabilities"]["tool_route"])
```

## Training Data & Target Reconciliation

Soro-Kev-0.8B was trained on the `nisaralll/soro-universal-tool-harness` dataset (`train.jsonl`), consisting of exactly **23,192 multi-task state rows**. Each row contains five question targets. During training, the non-permuted questions are packed into one sequence and the permutation probe is a second sequence in the same batch; this is a training batching strategy, not a guarantee that inference evaluates all questions in one pass. The run yields **115,960 machine-counted supervision targets**:

| Question Head | Question Type | Rows Present | Ground Truth Breakdown | Purpose & Learning Task |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`tool_route`** | `choice` | 23,192 | 23,192 valid closed-candidate selections + `__abstain__` | Primary tool routing decision across multi-protocol candidates |
| **`tool_route_perm`** | `choice` | 23,192 | 23,192 candidate order permutations | Enforces permutation invariance via Jensen-Shannon Divergence ($L_{JSD}$) |
| **`arg_mapping`** | `choice` | 23,192 | **16,457** active schema parameter mappings, **6,735** `__drop__` targets | Maps unrecognized/hallucinated LLM parameter keys to valid schema properties |
| **`is_mutation`** | `noul` (bool) | 23,192 | **5,700** `yes` (state-mutating), **17,492** `no` (read-only) | Classifies execution side-effect tier when MCP tool annotations are absent |
| **`missing_required`** | `noul` (bool) | 23,192 | **6,034** `yes` (missing required), **17,158** `no` (complete) | Guards against calling tools with incomplete required arguments |
| **Total** | — | **23,192** | **115,960 Supervision Targets** | Single-pass multi-task representation sharing |

Evaluation suites (`val_external_human.jsonl` with 1,200 held-out queries, and `val_zeroshot.jsonl` with 2,220 queries across 55 unseen packages) are strictly disjoint from training:
- **Package Overlap**: 0 packages (0 / 5 external, 0 / 55 zero-shot).
- **Exact Query Overlap**: 0 queries across all splits.
- **Near-Duplicate Queries**: 0 pairs at 3-gram Jaccard $\ge 0.75$, 1 pair at dense embedding cosine $\ge 0.88$.
- **Tool Name Overlap**: 4 generic tools (`check_service_status`, `list_processes`, `reverse_geocode`, `transfer_to_human_agents`) account for 162 rows (13.50%) in external holdout; 1,038 rows (86.50%) feature strictly disjoint tools whose names never appear in `train.jsonl`. Both subsets are reported separately below.
- **Audit Verification**: Committed in `scripts/verify_dataset_disjointness.py` and `benchmarks/disjointness_audit.json`.

## Evaluation Results

All models and baselines were evaluated on an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU** (6GB VRAM, PCIe 4.0 x4, PyTorch 2.6.0, CUDA 12.4). The coverage and prediction-set metrics below come from the calibration/evaluation pipeline over **100 random splits** (`N_cal = 500`, nominal coverage `1 - alpha = 0.90`). They are distinct from the production top-mass gate.

### 1. Decision Model & Retrieval Baseline Comparison (Full 1,200 External Rows across 115 Unique Base Queries)

*\*Note on Abstention: The 135 abstain rows represent 15 unique base queries evaluated across 9 format/distractor views each ($15 \times 9 = 135$). Denominators strictly reconcile: $1,065 + 135 = 1,200$. Numerators strictly reconcile: e.g. 0.8B gets $926 + 102 = 1,028$; 4B gets $964 + 123 = 1,087$. Dedicated adversarial refusal is evaluated on the 33-row BFCL v3 Irrelevance benchmark (Section 3).*

> **Pointer Network Guarantee**: Restricts candidate selection strictly to the closed candidate set + `__abstain__` (0% invalid or invented tool-name generation). The empirical misclassification rate ($1 - \text{Top-1 Accuracy}$) is **14.33% (172/1200)** on external holdouts.

### 2. Unseen Tool Package Split (2,220 evaluations across 55 held-out packages)

> **Note on Queries & Schemas**: Queries share structural template distributions with training while all 55 tool schemas
> and packages are strictly disjoint (0 package overlap with the 319 training packages).

*\*Hardware & Latency Note (RTX 4050 6GB Laptop GPU, Windows WDDM):*
- **Architecture Difference (Prefill vs. Autoregressive Decode):** Soro-Kev outputs routing + key-mapping decisions scoring candidate tools and an explicit `__abstain__` anchor via a dual linear pointer head in **1 single prefill forward pass** (124.2 ms for 0.8B, 648.6 ms for 4B) with 0 generated decode tokens. In contrast, generative models (`xLAM-2-1b-fc-r`, `Hammer2.1-1.5b`) generate full JSON tool calls with argument values (~27–32 decode tokens), requiring 1 prefill pass plus 24-32 sequential autoregressive decode steps (one forward pass per token).
- **In-VRAM vs. Sustained / Paged Latency:** In clean isolated VRAM bursts, `Arch-Router-1.5B` achieves a median latency of **1,212.9 ms** (~24 tokens generated). `xLAM-2-1b-fc-r` (mean prompt 406 tokens, mean gen 27 tokens) achieves **7,106.9 ms** median in clean VRAM (initial queries: ~1,458-2,549 ms; laptop GPU thermal throttling at 85C settles to ~7.1s). `Hammer2.1-1.5b` (generating full markdown JSON arrays of ~32 tokens) settles to **10,564.5 ms** median. When multiple generative models were evaluated sequentially without intermediate process garbage collection, Windows WDDM silently paged KV caches into Shared GPU Memory across PCIe, increasing latencies to ~10.4s-11.5s.
- **Dense Cosine & Neural Baselines:** All 100 BFCL rows for Dense Cosine were evaluated directly using `SentenceTransformer` / `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` forward passes on CUDA timed with `time.perf_counter()`, yielding a genuine hardware median latency of **8.5 ms** (6.3-60.4 ms range, 64/100 correct).

## Limitations and Trade-Offs

- **No Generative Argument Synthesis**: Soro-Kev normalizes parameter keys and checks argument completeness; it does not author free-text string values. In production pipelines, arguments are drafted by a fast parameter extractor, normalized via `arg_mapping`, and guarded by `missing_required` before execution.
- **Single-Turn Model**: Soro-Kev evaluates single routing turns. Multi-tool sequential chaining ("call tool A, then tool B") is an architectural runtime design and has not yet been benchmarked on multi-step traces.
- **Edge Model Capacity**: With 0.8B parameters, out-of-domain transfer on complex multi-hop semantic reasoning is lower than Soro-Kev-4B (85.67% vs 90.58% on external holdouts).
- **Abstention Sensitivity**: On BFCL irrelevance slices where queries closely resemble registered tools, Soro-Kev-0.8B abstains 51.52% (17/33) of the time, compared to 75.76% (25/33) for Soro-Kev-4B. For strict zero-tolerance out-of-domain rejection, use Soro-Kev-4B.
